Project Title:
Autoimmune Disease Risk Prediction from Human DNA Sequences Using SNP Markers and Biopython

Project Description:
This project develops a Python-based computational tool that analyzes human DNA sequences to predict the risk of autoimmune diseases. 
Leveraging known Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with various autoimmune conditions, the program scans input DNA sequences (in FASTA format) to detect these genetic variants. 
It uses a curated JSON database of SNP markers linked to diseases like Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriasis, Type 1 Diabetes, and others.
The tool is designed with Biopython to efficiently read and process DNA sequences and Matplotlib to visualize the predicted risk scores graphically. 
The output includes both a textual report and a horizontal bar chart showing the likelihood of each autoimmune disease based on detected SNPs.
This project demonstrates integration of bioinformatics data processing, genetic risk analysis, and data visualization to assist in early prediction of autoimmune disease susceptibility from genomic data.
